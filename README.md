## Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

**Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** are a type of neural network that integrate physical laws directly into the training process, enabling the solution of differential equations and other physics-based problems. Unlike conventional neural networks that rely primarily on empirical data, PINNs use known physical principles to guide the learning process and enhance the accuracy of predictions.

### Overview

PINNs are designed to address problems where the governing physical laws are known but the exact solution is difficult to obtain. They achieve this by embedding these physical laws into the loss function of the neural network, thus ensuring that the network's predictions not only fit the available data but also adhere to the governing equations.

### Key Components

- **Physics-Based Loss Function**: The loss function in PINNs combines traditional data-driven terms with physics-based terms. The data-driven loss ensures the network's predictions are accurate relative to known data, while the physics-based loss ensures the predictions comply with physical laws represented by differential equations.

- **Governing Equations**: PINNs solve partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by incorporating them into the network's training process. These equations are used to define the physics-based loss component.

- **Boundary and Initial Conditions**: PINNs can also incorporate boundary and initial conditions into the loss function, ensuring that the network's predictions are consistent with these conditions.

### Benefits

- **Accuracy**: By incorporating physical laws, PINNs can achieve higher accuracy in regions where data may be sparse or noisy.
- **Generalization**: PINNs are capable of generalizing solutions to new conditions or scenarios by leveraging the underlying physical principles.
- **Flexibility**: PINNs can be applied to a wide range of problems across various fields, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural mechanics, and more.

### Example Application

In a typical PINNs application, you would:
1. Define the governing differential equations that describe the physical system.
2. Construct the neural network and its loss function to include both data fitting and physics constraints.
3. Train the network using available data and the physics-based loss terms to find an accurate approximation of the solution to the differential equations.

In this repository, we have selected and solved various differential equations. We then analyzed the results by comparing them to analytical solutions through plotting or by evaluating the error produced by the neural networks.
